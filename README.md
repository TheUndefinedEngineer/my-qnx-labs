# Hands-on QNX RTOS experiments and system-level programming

### Experiment 1
_*Still have to finalize_

### Experiment 2
Aim: To implement a multithreaded application using POSIX threads in which multiple threads process different segments of an array concurrently, and to synchronize the execution of threads using the pthread_join() function.
