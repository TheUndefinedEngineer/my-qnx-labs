# Hands-on QNX RTOS experiments and system-level programming

## Experiment 1
A. Aim : To write a program that creates multiple child processes using fork() and print different messages in parent and child process. Terminate the parent after 5 seconds and print the pid from the child.

## Experiment 2
Aim : To implement a multithreaded application using POSIX threads in which multiple threads process different segments of an array concurrently, and to synchronize the execution of threads using the pthread_join() function.
